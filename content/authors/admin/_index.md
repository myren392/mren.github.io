I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Economics](https://econ.duke.edu/) at Duke University.

I am interested in environmental and energy economics, climate policy, development economics, and public economics. My research topics encompass energy transition, climate change mitigation and adaptation, innovation and development, and environmental regulation. I aim to tackle pressing policy issues tied to environmental and energy challenges in the US and emerging economies, by integrating microeconomic theory, innovative data, and advanced econometric tools. My recent work focuses on:
* Energy transition, electrification, and policy designs for the net-zero emissions target
* Climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience
* Welfare impacts of technology upgrades and infrastructure investments in the electricity sector
* Information, risk perception, and household behavior

I received my B.A. in Economics and B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

üîé**I am on the 2024-25 job market.**
