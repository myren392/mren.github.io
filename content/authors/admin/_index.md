I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Environmental Policy (Economics Track)](https://nicholas.duke.edu/academics/doctoral-programs/university-program-environmental-policy-upep) at Duke University. I am also a [James B. Duke Fellow](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/history-spotlight-james-b-duke-fellowship) and a student fellow affiliated with the [Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability](https://energy.duke.edu/about/energy-fellows) and the [James E. Rogers Energy Access Project](https://energyaccess.duke.edu/team/zhenxuan/).

I am interested in environmental and energy economics, climate policy, development economics, and public economics. My research topics encompass energy transition, climate change mitigation and adaptation, innovation and development, and environmental regulation. I aim to tackle pressing policy issues tied to environmental and energy challenges in the US and emerging economies, by integrating microeconomic theory, innovative data, and advanced econometric tools. My recent work focuses on:
* Energy transition, electrification, and policy designs for the net-zero emissions target
* Climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience
* Welfare impacts of technology upgrades and infrastructure investments in the electricity sector
* Information, risk perception, and household behavior

Prior to Duke, I was a research associate at the [Environmental Research Center](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/environment/about-research) of [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/). I received my B.A. in Economics and B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

The pronunciation of my name is similar to /d í…õn  Éw…ën w…í≈ã/. In Chinese, it is ÁéãÊåØËΩ©.
