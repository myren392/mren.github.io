abstract: 'This paper examines how digitalization impacts public service provision through a study of the U.S. power sector. We exploit the staggered timing of electric utilitiesâ€™ investments in smart meters and find that electricity losses per unit sold decrease by 3.6%. This efficiency improvement is driven by a 5.9% reduction in total losses and 1.2% increase in sales. Additional results suggest this occurs through improvements in energy management. The effects are driven by government-owned utilities as opposed to privately-owned. Through a supplementary analysis of within-utility electricity reliability in Texas, we also find that digitalization decreased power outage duration but not frequency.'
