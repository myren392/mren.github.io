As an instructor, my goal is to build students' knowledge of economics concepts, equip them with essential analytic tools for understanding the world around them, and more importantly, engage them in evidence-based policy-making processes. There are three principles I embrace in teaching and incorporate into all of my interactions with students: (1) student-centered personalized learning; (2) active and inclusive learning; (3) application and real-world connections.
